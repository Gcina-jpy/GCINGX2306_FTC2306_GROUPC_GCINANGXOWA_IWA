//Fixed the function declarations by using the correct syntax (const functionName = () => { ... }).

//Corrected the assignment within the logCalc function to update the calculated variable correctly.

//Added missing parentheses () when calling the logCalc function within the calcUser function.

//With these changes, your code should run as intended. It will call calcUser() 
//and checkUser() in sequence five times, each time potentially updating the user and state 
//variables and logging the user information if the conditions are met.
